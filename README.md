## Web Demo

You can find a live demo of Pelagica web at:

https://demo.pelagica.app/

The demo instance has the `jellyfin.streamyfin.app` server with a username preconfigured, so you just have to click "Login" to test it out. If your own Jellyfin server is publicly accessible, you can also use that by entering the server URL and your credentials.

For production use, you should self-host Pelagica using Docker or another method.

Thank you to [Streamyfin](https://streamyfin.app/) for providing a demo Jellyfin server for testing!

## Installation options

### Web Installation

Pelagica web is distributed as a Docker image. See the [Installation](https://pelagica.app/docs/installation) and [Configuration](https://pelagica.app/docs/configuration) docs for setup instructions, and [Themes](https://pelagica.app/docs/themes) for applying custom themes.

### Desktop App

Pelagica is also available as a native desktop app for macOS, Windows, and Linux, built with [Wails v3](https://v3.wails.io). Download the latest build for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/PelagicaApp/pelagica/releases/latest) page.

- **macOS:** Not notarized, so Gatekeeper will flag it — right-click the app and choose "Open" to bypass.
- **Windows:** Not signed with an Authenticode certificate, so SmartScreen will flag it.
- **Linux:** Available as a `.deb` package, a `.pkg.tar.zst` package (Arch Linux), or an `.AppImage`.

See the [desktop README](./desktop/README.md) for build and packaging instructions if you'd rather build it yourself.

#### Homebrew (macOS)

On Apple Silicon, Pelagica can be installed and kept up to date through the [Homebrew tap](https://github.com/PelagicaApp/homebrew-pelagica):

```sh
brew tap PelagicaApp/pelagica
brew trust PelagicaApp/pelagica
brew install --cask pelagica
```

Since the app is not notarized, clear the quarantine attribute once after installing:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Pelagica.app"
```

Later updates are just `brew upgrade --cask pelagica`.

### Samsung Tizen

Pelagica is available as a Tizen app for Samsung Smart TVs. See the [Tizen Documentation](https://pelagica.app/docs/tizen) for installation instructions.

### LG webOS

Pelagica is available as a webOS app for LG Smart TVs. See the [webOS Documentation](https://pelagica.app/docs/webos) for installation instructions.

## What does that name mean?

You might be wondering about the name "Pelagica". Since I didn't want to call it the usual "\*fin" or "jelly\*" names, I looked for synonyms related to the sea. "Pelagic" refers to living in the deep ocean, which felt fitting for a Jellyfin frontend.

## Acknowledgements

Pelagica’s design was inspired by the [finetic](https://github.com/AyaanZaveri/finetic) Jellyfin frontend.  
No code was used; this project is an independent implementation.
